# Now Fear This: A Daggerheart-compatible encounter builder and tracker

A tool for folks like me who can't draw squares very quickly.

* Keep track of _HP, Stress, and Conditions_ for any number of adversaries.
* Easily _browse adversaries_ from the SRD or your own custom list.
* Edit any adversary and _make it your own_.
* Manage multiple encounters and _keep track of your Fear_ from session to session.
* Save and share your encounters (or just your custom stat blocks) with a _simple JSON format_.
* Works _entirely offline_, no accounts, no ads, no tracking or cookies. State is persisted in `localStorage`.
* [Download and run _your own copy_](https://codeberg.org/sandyarmstrong/nowfearthis/archive/main.zip) from your desktop. No build, no package manager, no dependencies.
